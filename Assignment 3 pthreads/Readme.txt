Loop_scheduler_script:	Mamaba Script for running Numericalintegration sequential code and loop scheduler parallel code. This script also plots the graph in folder ./graphdata


Task_scheduler_script: Mamba script for running task scheduler. This script runs the mock strassen sequential code and parallel codeandplots speedup char in ./task_data folder.


Document: Assignment3.doc contains the writeup for section 2.2 task scheduler question number 3 and 4.Also folder task_data contains ploted graph for question 2, 3 and 4 of section 2.2 (Task Scheduler)
